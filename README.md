<h2<Brown Motion</h2>

<p>The Brown-Motion program is a computer simulation that calculates the coordinates of points simulating Brownian motion and then generates a plot of particle displacement. Plot a leading vector (displacement), saves the data to a file and gives the possibility to read data from the file.</p>

<p>Brown motion is a phenomenon in which small particles or pollens in a gas or suspension spontaneously and seemingly without reason make constant chaotic movements in different directions.The moddeling has been carried out using the *Monte Carlo* method, which consists in modelling physical processes by drawing lots to characterise the process and estimating the result on the basis of the data thus obtained. The molecule at the origin is at the center of the coordinate system (0,0).</p>

<p>In each move the the parcicle moves by a constant vector of length |r| given by the user also by the number of steps given by the user. The direction, on the other hand, will be determined by a random angle. The program also saves itself to a text file, which can later be read by selecting the appropriate option in the menu. The whole program was written using functional programming but with clean code rules so shat you can easily understand what is happening one by one. </p>

***Tools used :
- NumPy -> scientifc calculations, mathematical functions <br>
- ***Matplotlib.pyplot -> creating plots <br>
- ***Random module -> generating pseudo-random numbers to randomiza the coordinate angle <br>
- ***Time module -> generating pseudo-random numbers <br>
- ***Exception handling -> preventing errors*** <br>
